###Hangperson Game
- **The Game**
  - [X] The game selects a random word from a word list and makes that the secret word
  - [X] The player guesses one letter at a time, trying to figure out what the word is
  - [X] If the player guesses correctly, any instances of that letter are revealed in the secret word
  - [X] If the player guesses incorrectly, they are penalized by taking away a guess
  - [X] If a player reveals all of the letters of the secret word, they win
  - [ ] If a player makes 8 incorrect guesses before solving the secret word, they lose
  - [X] Display current state of the word with non-guessed characters as underscores
  - [X] Multiple guesses must be possible
- **To Do**
  - Plan out your object model. What variables and functions will each object have? How will the different objects communicate with each other?
  - Get the logic to work and make sure you have the game working in the console first **BEFORE** translating it over to update the DOM.
  - Translate your game over so it updates the DOM.
    - Implement a "reset" button that will reset the game and choose a new word
      - Implement a "give up" button that will show the solution
  - Validate the input so that only single letters are accepted as guesses
- **Bonus**
  - Change the input format so that there is no text field. You can get input by "listening" to the keyup event and figuring out which key was pressed.
- **Bonus**
  - Draw the hangperson stick figure using CSS
- **Bonus**
  - Implement a "hint" button that will reveal one of the letters in the word
